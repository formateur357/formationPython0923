Exercise: Interact with the PokeAPI

Introduction: The PokeAPI provides data on Pokémon species, their abilities, types, and more. You can use it to retrieve detailed information about various Pokémon.

Task: Write a Python program that does the following:

Ask the user to enter the name or ID of a Pokémon.
Use the requests module to send a GET request to the PokeAPI to fetch data about the specified Pokémon.
Parse the JSON response from the API to extract and display information such as the Pokémon's name, abilities, and types.
Hints:

You can access the PokeAPI at https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{pokemon_name_or_id}/, where {pokemon_name_or_id} should be replaced with the name or ID of the Pokémon entered by the user.

The PokeAPI response will be in JSON format. You'll need to examine the structure of the JSON response to extract the information you need. You can refer to the PokeAPI documentation for details: PokeAPI Documentation

Here's a code example to get you started:

Exercise 1: Retrieve a Random Pokémon

Write a Python program that retrieves information about a random Pokémon from the PokeAPI. Display the Pokémon's name, abilities, and types. You can use the random module to select a random Pokémon ID (between 1 and 898) and then fetch its data from the API.

Exercise 2: Retrieve a Pokémon's Evolution Chain

Write a program that allows the user to enter the name or ID of a Pokémon. Fetch the evolution chain for that Pokémon from the PokeAPI and display the names of the Pokémon in the evolution chain. If the Pokémon has multiple evolution paths, display all of them.

Exercise 3: Search for Pokémon by Type

Write a program that allows the user to enter a Pokémon type (e.g., "fire," "water," "electric") and retrieve a list of Pokémon that belong to that type from the PokeAPI. Display the names of the Pokémon that match the type.

Exercise 4: Retrieve a Pokémon's Moves

Write a program that allows the user to enter the name or ID of a Pokémon. Fetch and display a list of the Pokémon's moves, including their names and power points (PP).

These exercises will help you practice different aspects of working with the PokeAPI, including fetching data, handling user input, and displaying relevant information.
