Expanded Exercise: Employee Management with Polymorphism

In this exercise, we'll continue working with the Employee class hierarchy. We have three types of employees: FullTimeEmployee, HourlyEmployee, and a new type called Contractor. Additionally, we'll introduce the concept of benefits for full-time employees.

Step 1: Employee Base Class

Create a base class Employee with an attribute name.
Step 2: Implement Benefits for Full-Time Employees

Extend the FullTimeEmployee class to include benefits such as health insurance and retirement contributions. These benefits should be added to the salary.
Step 3: Create a Contractor Class

Create a new class Contractor that also inherits from Employee. Contractors have an hourly rate and a fixed number of hours worked.
Step 4: Calculate Salary for Contractors

Implement the calculate_salary method for contractors to calculate their salary based on the hourly rate and hours worked.
Step 5: Calculate Total Compensation for Full-Time Employees

Create a method in the FullTimeEmployee class to calculate the total compensation, including salary and benefits. Display the total compensation for full-time employees.
Step 6: Demonstrate Polymorphism

Create instances of FullTimeEmployee, HourlyEmployee, and Contractor.
Calculate and display the salary or total compensation for each employee using polymorphism.
